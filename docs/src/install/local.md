The installation and usage of the _NixOSCompose_ differs in function of the state at which the project you are working on is. In the case of a new project you will want to install the `nxc` command line tool as it is described in [Local Installation](local.md#local-installationusage). If the project you are working on is already using because you are developing it or in the case of the rerun of an experiment conducted in the past you prefer to use the version of `nxc` link to the project, accessing/invoke this specific version of the tool is described in [Linked/project embeded `nxc`](local.md#linkedproject-embeded-nxc)


# Requirements

- Nix package manager with flake feature activated (see [NixOS website](https://nixos.org/download.html) and [NixOS wiki](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes#Installing_flakes))

```admonish note title="Quick note from NixOS wiki to activate flake feature"
- Non-NixOS

    Edit `~/.config/nix/nix.conf` to add this line :
    ```
    experimental-features = nix-command flakes
    ```
- NixOS

    Edit your configuration by adding the following options
    ```nix
    { pkgs, ... }: {
        nix = {
            package = pkgs.nixFlakes; # or versioned attributes like nixVersions.nix_2_8
            extraOptions = ''
                experimental-features = nix-command flakes
            '';
        };
    }
    ```
```

## Configuration requierements

On NixOS you need to enable the dockers functionnality, in our case there is a compatibility issue with cgroupv2 so it is needed to force cgroupv1 with the option `systemd.enableUnifiedCgroupHierarchy`.

```nix
# Docker enabled + cgroup v1
virtualisation.docker.enable = true;
systemd.enableUnifiedCgroupHierarchy = false;
```


# Local installation/usage

The following commands will drop you in a shell where the `nxc` command is available and all required runtime dependencies (docker-compose, vde2, tmux, qemu_kvm).

```shell
git clone https://gitlab.inria.fr/nixos-compose/nixos-compose.git
cd nixos-compose
nix develop .#nxcShellFull
```
## Alternative

You can take advantage of the full potential of Nix's flakes. The following command will drop you in the same shell without having to clone the repository.
```shell
nix develop https://gitlab.inria.fr/nixos-compose/nixos-compose.git#nxcShellFull
```

~~~admonish tip
Writting the full url is not really practical, an "alias" can be used.
```shell
nix registry add nxc git+https://gitlab.inria.fr/nixos-compose/nixos-compose.git
```
The command becomes :
```shell
nix develop nxc#nxcShellFull
```
~~~

# Linked/project embedded `nxc`

A project that is already using _NixOSCompose_ in its experiments process provides an easy access to a shell with the `nxc` tool and its runtime dependencies if needed. This is achieved thanks to Nix and flakes feature. By default, a project has a line in its `flake.nix` similar to this :

```nix
devShell.${system} = nxc.devShells.${system}.nxcShellFull;
```

It exposes the shell of _NixOSCompose_ as in the previous section but with the specific revision thanks to the `flake.lock` file. The shell is accessible with the command `nix develop`. It is useful to explore what shells are available in the project, to list them you use `nix flake show`. Then to access the devShell of your choice use this command :

```shell
nix develop .#nxcShellFull
```

```admonish info
Two shells availables :
- `nxcShell`
    - python app `nxc`

- `nxcShellFull`
    - python app `nxc`
    - docker-compose
    - vde2
    - tmux
    - qemu_kvm
```

<!-- 

2 scenarii are possible, either you are working on a new project or you are on one already using _NixOSCompose_, in this latter case and if the `flake.nix` still contains this following line
If you are working on a project that already uses _NixOSCompose_ you should use the nxc provided with it, it will use the exact version of the tool used to build it, the one used for the project. It is recommended. Or you can use you own installation like described in part ##.

_NixOSCompose_, thanks to Nix package manager, does not always need to be installed in a classical way. In the case where you are picking up a project which is already using _NixOSCompose_ it should not be necessary to an installation. If instead you are starting a new project you need to do 


## 2 scenarios

Depending on you usage you will not need to follow the same installation procedure. Starting a new project requires to initialize de project

### 2 scenarii possible
Either you are going to create a new project or you are using a project that was produced by NixOSCompose
Shell Nix avec NXC disponible
```
nix shell

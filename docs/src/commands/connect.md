The command `nxc connect` opens one or more terminal sessions into the deployed machines. By default, it will connect to all nodes, but we can specify which ones to connect to.

How can we connect to several machines at once? For this, we use a tmux (terminal multiplexer) session. Feel free to refer to the [tmux documentation](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) (or its [cheatsheet](https://tmuxcheatsheet.com/)), expecially for the shortcuts to navigate between the different tabs.

Some of the options of `nxc connect`:

- `-g, --geometry`

    Tmux geometry, 2 splitting indications are supported: +/\*.

    Examples: "1+3+2" (3 sucessive panes respectively horizontally splited by 1,3 and 2), "2\*3" (2 sucessive panes horizontally splitted by 3)

- `-d, --deployment-file` <!-- TODO: a voir si gardÃ©e -->

    Deployment file. By default it takes the latest created in the `deploy` directory

- `-pc, --pane-console`

    Add a regular shell pane to the tmux session.

- `-i, --identity-file TEXT`

    The path to the ssh (private) key to use to connect to the deployments. It has to be the counterpart of the key that would have been given to `nxc start` (albeit with the same command line argument).
